## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

I created a study guide to help me list all the topics i have learnt over the prework course module, the reason why i have built this project is to help me remember the core languages and tools such as HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and Git. 
It has taught me how to structure a HTML file, Design a site using CSS and how to add interactivity using Javascript. Ive somewhat learnt how to use git by saving, commit and pushing to github. i still need more practice on this subject and learn how to use the command more effectively.  





## Installation
I have installed VS Code, to allow me to write code and debug. Ive also installed git into my terminal. 

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
